# Causal Inference: An Introduction

"Correlation is not causality" is one of the most frequently used lines in social science. In a lab experiment, a researcher can perform controlled experiments to determine whether A causes B by controlling for confounders. However, the complexities and interrelations of human behavior create a setting starkly different from the controlled environment of a lab, making things much more convoluted. Causal inference, therefore, can be seen as a process to determine whether A causes B in both lab settings and out-of-lab scenarios. 

**A simple example.** 
Say, we are interested in evaluating the effects of a tutoring program on exam scores for an introductory course. 


To begin, in this simple example, we assume that the treatment is (completely) randomly assigned. The class is randomly divided into two groups: one group receives the treatment **(treatment group)** and the other group does not receive the treatment **(control group)**. Proper randomization means that each individual has an equal probability of receiving the treatment or not receiving it. This approach with an arbitrarily high probability ensures balance in both observed and unobserved factors as the sample size grows such that any differences in outcomes between the treatment and control groups can be attributed to the treatment itself, rather than to pre-existing differences between the groups.^[Of course, balance is not guranteed and in such cases one should think hard whether differences in covariates matter, and if they do, adjustment should be applied.] *Balance* here is defined as an instance when all pre-treatment covariates between the treatment and control groups are similar. If this is attained then it increases confidence that the treatment and the control units are comparable. 

**Set up.** We use $W$ to denote the treatment status such that 
$W_i \in \{0, \; 1\}$, $Y_i$ is the exam score following the treatment assignment, and $X_i$ are the covariates (e.g., gender, race). The subscript $i$ 
indicates an individual or unit of observation.



## Potential Outcome Framework: Neyman-Rubin Causal Model 

We are going to use the potential outcome framework to describe the impacts of the treatment following the Neyman-Rubin causal model [@splawa1990; @rubin1974]. Define $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ as the potential outcomes for an individual $i$ in the case of treatment and without treatment, respectively. The potential outcomes are not realized yet. As such it is wrong to say that $Y_{i}(0) = Y_i$. Let's spend some time discussing various formats of the potential outcome in relation to what is observed versus what is not. 

i) $[Y_{i}(0)|W_i = 0].$ Here, the expression in the bracket is read as the outcome of an unit $i$ in the no-treatment state conditional upon $i$ actually not receiving the treatment. This is an observed outcome.   
ii) $[Y_{i}(0)|W_i = 1].$ Here, the expression is asking for what the outcome of an unit $i$ who received the treatment $(W_i = 1)$ would be in absence of the treatment. This is not observed and is termed as the counterfactual.

The same goes with the potential outcome $Y_{i}(1)$ -- the outcome if $i$ were to be treated.

The observed variable, $Y_i$, can be written as a function 
of the potential outcomes as follows:

\begin{equation}
Y_i = W \times Y_i(1) + (1-W)\times Y_i(0)
\end{equation} 

The fundamental problem is that one cannot observe both $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ at the same time. As such, the causal inference through the lens of Neyman-Rubin causal framework can be seen as the missing data problem. If one has the data for $Y_i(1)$ then the $Y_i(0)$ counterpart is missing and vice-versa. Much of causal inference is finding ways to deal with the missing-data problem. 

The **independence assumption** allows us to proceed further with causality. 
Formally, a complete random assignment of treatment means: $W_i \perp Y_i(0), Y_i(1)$. This states that the treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes. Quite literally, this means that the treatment assignment is not related to the potential outcome. In other words, the treatment assignment is completely random (probability of being treated is 0.5 in the case of binary treatment).  

The independence assumption also states that the treatment assignment is independent of any covariates $X_i$. In our particular example, this means that the probability of receiving the treatment is the same for different groups defined by these covariates, such as gender and race. Specifically, females are equally likely to get treated compared to males, and Blacks are equally likely to be treated compared to Whites. Within both the treatment and control groups, it is highly likely that the proportion of Blacks and Whites, as well as males and females, will be similar -- an attribute known as balance.

The **independence assumption** is one of the necessary assumptions to proceed further but it is not sufficient. Additional two assumptions are needed to proceed ahead: **overlap** and **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)**. The overlap assumption states that observations in both the treatment and control groups fall within the common support. For instance, this assumption is violated if the treatment group consist of all females and the control group consist of all males as one would not be able to attain balance in covariates. The independence and overlap assumption together constitute a property known as **stong ignorability** of assignment, which is necessary for the identification of the treatment effect. The SUTVA assumption is the *no interference assumption* defining that the treatment status of one unit should not affect the potential outcome for other units. In our example, tutoring treatment for a unit in the treatment group should not change the potential outcome for other units. This assumption breaks down if there is a spillover effect, for example, if the a student in the treatment group helps her friend in the control group. 


## Average treatment effect (ATE) 

Our target is to estimate the effects of the treatment.

For a brief moment, let's assume the presence of a parallel universe that includes Alia, Ryan, Shrey, Samaira, and Rakshya in the course. In one universe (actual universe) the treatment for these individuals are randomly allocated: $W_{Alia} = 1$, $W_{Ryan} = 0$, $W_{Shrey} = 0$, $W_{Samaira} = 1$,  $W_{Rakshya} = 0$. In the other (parallel) universe, everything is similar to the actual universe except that the treatment 
status is exactly opposite. In this case, individual specific treatment effect can be estimated by taking the difference in individual specific outcomes across two universes. For example, the treatment effect for Alia is $Y_{Alia}(1) - Y_{Alia}(0).$ This is feasible since a perfect counterfactual is available for all the units given the parallel universe. The average of such individual treatment effect gives the average treatment effect, ATE. 

The target is to estimate **average treatment effect (ATE)**, which is defined as: 

\begin{equation} 
ATE = E(Y_i(1)) - E(Y_i(0))
\end{equation}

$Y_i(1)$ denotes the outcome for an unit $i$ in presence of treatment, whereas $Y_i(0)$ is the realization for the same unit $i$ in absence of the treatment. As we know, it is impossible to measure the unit $i$ in two different states (with and without treatment).


A major difficulty is that one cannot observe units simultaneously with and without treatment in reality. This means that the perfect counterfactual does not really exist.
This again emphasizes causal inference as a missing data problem -- when estimating the treatment effect of an unit $i$, $Y_i(0)$ is not observed if $Y_i(1)$ is and vice-versa. This unfortunately does not allow us to estimate individualized treatment effect. The best we can do (as of yet) is use the **independence assumption** as well as **overlap** assumption together and evalute ATE. 

Note that the independence condition, $ W_i \perp Y_i(0), \; Y_i(1)$, gives: $E(Y_i(0)|W_i = 1) = E(Y_i(0)|W_i = 0)$. The term, $E(Y_i(0))$, in ATE equation is replaced by $E(Y_i|W_i = 0)$.  


In the case of a pure randomized experiment, the ATE is given as: 

\begin{equation}
ATE = E(Y_i | W_i = 1) - E(Y_i | W_i = 0)
\end{equation}

 
ATE evaluates treatment effect for the whole population by comparing the treated units to the control units.  

## RCT 

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the cornerstone of causal inference and are often referred to as the gold standard. The quality of non-experimental studies is frequently assessed by comparing how closely the observational setting approximates an RCT. In an RCT, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is identified through the randomization of treatment assignment. This process ensures that the treatment and control groups are comparable, making RCTs a straightforward yet immensely powerful tool for establishing causal relationships.

In a simple RCT setting the treatment is binary -- the units are either assigned to the treatment group $(W_i = 0)$ or the control group $(W_i = 1)$. The implicit assumption in this design is that each unit has an equal probability of being treated. The treatment assignment for the RCT setting can be attained using a Bernoulli process, where each unit has an independent probability $\pi$ of receiving treatment. Specifically, each unit is assigned to the treatment group with probability $\pi$ and to the control group with probability $1 - \pi$. 

A practical example of this is an unbiased coin toss used to determine treatment assignment. In this case, a head could correspond to the treatment group (e.g., $W_i = 1$), and a tail to the control group (e.g., $W_i = 0$). This method exemplifies Bernoulli-randomization, where the assignment is determined by a random process, ensuring that each unit has an equal probability of being assigned to either group.

In an RCT setting, the difference-in-means estimator is given as: 

\begin{equation} 
\hat{tau} = \frac{1}{N_t}\sum_{W_i =1} Y_i - \frac{1}{N_c}\sum_{W_i =0} Y_i
\end{equation}

The difference-in-mean estimator is unbiased and consistent for the average treatment effect.

## Average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)
The **average treatment effect on the treated** is concerned with the evaluation of treatment effects for only those units that are treated. Formally, it is defined as: 

\begin{equation}
ATT = E(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | W_i = 1)
\end{equation}

ATE is only concerned with a subset of the population who received the treatment, $E[.|W_i = 1]$. Here, ATT is comparing outcomes among the treated units in presence of the treatment versus what the outcomes would have been in absence of the treatment only for units receiving the treatment. Hence, only one segment of the counterfactual (potential outcome) is required. In our example, the counterfactual for Alia and Samaira would allow estimation of ATT, whereas ATE requires counterfactual for everyone.

The independence condition states that on average the potential outcomes for the treated group in absence of the treatment would be similar to the average outcome for the control group, i.e. $E(Y_i(0)|W_i = 1) = E(Y_i(0)|W_i = 0)$. This allows re-writing ATT as the following: 

\begin{align}
ATT = E\{E(Y_i | W_i = 1) - E(Y_i | W_i = 0) | W_i = 1\} \\
ATT = E(Y_i | W_i = 1) - E(Y_i | W_i = 0) 
\end{align}

The second line follows from the independence assumption which allows this: $E\{E(Y_i | W_i = 0) | W_i = 1\} = E(Y_i | W_i = 0).$ Under the **independence assumption** this means that we can estimate ATT by substrating the averages of exam score across the treated and control units. In purely randomized experiments, if there is a perfect case of compliance, then the ATT will be similar to ATE.

## An estimation example 

```{r}
# create a function to estimate the treatment effects
fun_ATE  <- function(tau, N){
# @arg tau: true treatment effect
# @arg N:   sample size
# Return tau_hat: estimate of the treatment effect      
    gender  <- rbinom(N, size = 1, p = 0.5)
    race  <- rbinom(N, size = 1, p = 0.5)
    W  <- rbinom(N, size = 1, p = 0.5)    
    Y  <- 50 + tau * W  + gender * 5 + race * 10 + rnorm(n = N, mean = 5, sd = 5)

    tau_hat  <-  mean(Y[which(W == 1)]) - mean(Y[which(W == 0)]) 
    return(tau_hat)
}

# print treatment effect
print(paste("the ATE estimate is: ", fun_ATE(tau = 10, N = 2000)))


# run 2000 replications to get a distribution of tau_hats
reps  <-  2000
tau.hats  <- rep(0, reps)

for(i in 1:reps){
    tau.hats[i]  <- fun_ATE(tau = 10, N = 2000)
}

# histogram of tau hats
hist(tau.hats, breaks = 30)

# obtaining the standard error
print(paste("the mean of tau hats : ", mean(tau.hats)))
print(paste("the standard error of tau hats : ", sd(tau.hats)))

```

## Unconfoundedness assumption 

Most of the time the treatment assignment may not be fully random but can be driven by some selective covariates. Referring to the tutoring example, it may be unethical to disallow someone in the control group who wants to attend the tutoring sessions. As such, tutoring sessions may be voluntarily held, where students can select whether to attend the session. 


Say, females and Blacks are more likely to attend the tutoring session and both of these variables are also likely to yield higher potential outcome. This means that females and Blacks are more likely to have higher exam score in absence of the treatment compared to males and Whites. It is easy to see that the treatment assignment is correlated with the potential outcomes and the **independence assumption** is violated. This is true in many cases of observational settings and even in randomized experiments. We require adjustments before being able to estimate treatment effects in such cases.  

If we understand the treatment mechanism fairly well then we can still proceed further to estimate the treatment effects. For example, suppose the treatment assignment is (voluntarily)
more tilted towards females than males and Blacks than Whites. In this case, we would want to invoke unconfoundedness (**conditional independence**) assumption.^[The terms unconfoundedness and conditional independence ($heart\; disease \perp age \; | \; cholestrol$) are used interchangebly in causal inference literature. Conditional independence is a broader term that relates to the general field of probability and statistics, whereas unconfoundedness is more specific to causal inference. Unconfoundedness implies a specific kind of conditional independence, specific to causal inference.] Formally, this states that $Y_i(0), \; Y_i(1) \perp W_i  | X_i$. This means that conditional upon the covariates the treatment assignment is random. 

To estimate ATT one would want to first estimate ATT within each strata: $i)$ female-Black, $ii)$ female-White, $iii)$ male-Black, and $iv)$ male-White, and take a weighted average of the strata-specific ATEs by using the proportion of the sample in the given strata as weights. The conditional independence assumption means that within each strata treatment assignment is random. The following code first estimates the strata specific ATTs and then summarizes them using the weighted average. Note that the true treatment effect is 10.

```{r}
 fun_ATE2  <- function(N, tau){

# @arg tau: true treatment effect
# @arg N:   sample size
# Return tau_hat: estimate of the treatment effect using conditional randomness assumption   
# Return tau_hat2: estimate of the treatment effect wrongly using unconditional independence assumption
# Return reg_tau: estimate from conditioning using regression but from a misspecified model

    # create pseudo data
    gender  <- rbinom(N, size = 1, p = 0.5)
    race  <- rbinom(N, size = 1, p = 0.5)
    W  <- rbinom(N, size = 1, p = 0.2 + 0.4 * (gender > 0) + 0.2 * (race > 0))    
    Y  <- 40 + 10 * W  + gender * 2 + race * 5 + 25 * race * gender + rnorm(n = N, mean = 5, sd = 5)


    # female-Blacks
    tau_hat1  <-  mean(Y[which(W == 1 & gender == 1 & race == 1)]) - mean(Y[which(W == 0 & gender == 1 & race == 1)]) 
    w1  <- sum(gender == 1 & race == 1) / N

    # female-Whites
    tau_hat2  <-  mean(Y[which(W == 1 & gender == 1 & race == 0)]) - mean(Y[which(W == 0 & gender == 1 & race == 0)]) 
    w2  <- sum(gender == 1 & race == 0) / N

    # male-Blacks
    tau_hat3  <-  mean(Y[which(W == 1 & gender == 0 & race == 1)]) - mean(Y[which(W == 0 & gender == 0 & race == 1)]) 
    w3  <- sum(gender == 0 & race == 1) / N

    # male-Whites
    tau_hat4  <-  mean(Y[which(W == 1 & gender == 0 & race == 0)]) - mean(Y[which(W == 0 & gender == 0 & race == 0)]) 
    w4  <- sum(gender == 0 & race == 0) / N

    tau_hat  <- tau_hat1 * w1 + tau_hat2 * w2 + tau_hat3 * w3 + tau_hat4 * w4
    tau_hat2  <- mean(Y[W == 1]) - mean(Y[W == 0])

    # a mis-specified regression model
    reg  <- lm(Y ~ W + gender)
    reg_tau  <- coefficients(reg)[[2]]

    return(list(table(gender[W == 1]), table(race[W == 1]), tau_hat, tau_hat2, reg_tau))
}

ATE2_results  <- fun_ATE2(N = 20000, tau = 10)
print(paste(c("treated males: ", "treated females: ") , ATE2_results[[1]]))
print(paste(c("treated Whites: ", "treated Blacks: ") , ATE2_results[[2]])) 

print(paste("ATE conditioned on Xs is :", ATE2_results[[3]]))
print(paste("ATE not conditioned on Xs is :", ATE2_results[[4]]))


# get tau_hats from replications 

store  <- rep(0, reps) 
store2  <- store 
store.reg  <- store

for(i in 1:reps){
    ATE.results  <- fun_ATE2(N = 20000, tau = 10)
    store[i] <- ATE.results[[3]]
    store2[i]  <- ATE.results[[4]]
    store.reg[i]  <- ATE.results[[5]]
}

# histogram of tau_hat conditioned 
hist(store, main = "tau hats conditioned")
print(paste("The standard error from the conditioned approach is:", sd(store)))
hist(store2, main = "tau hats not conditioned")

```

The ATT estimate is much closer to the true parameter, 10, when conditioned upon the covariates as compared to an unconditional approach (where the distribution of ATT estimate is centered around 19.3).
This example highlights the importance of conditioning on $X$s when evaluating the treatment effects if the treatment assignment is correlated with the potential outcomes. In this case, Blacks and females are more likely to have higher scores in general even without the treatment and both of these subgroups are also more likely to be treated. Treatment is not only non-random but is systematically correlated with the outcomes. 

Since we have the perfect information on the treatment assignment mechanism, after conditioning for the covariates the treatment assignment is essentially random. In other words, within Black vs. White race groups, for example, the treatment assignment is randomly allocated. This allows estimation of ATE for each subgroup or strata. After estimating ATE for each strata, the ATEs are averaged using the sample size of the strata as weights.

One problem with the approach highlighted above is that in complex settings, with many determinants (multi-dimensionality) of treatment or in presence of continuous covariates, the sub-space required for the analyses highlighted above will be thinned out too soon. As an alternative, **regression framework** has been rigorously used as a tool-kit to control for covariates. While there are benefits of using a regression framework, it is by nomeans a panacea. This is especially true if the regression models are misspecified. Below we will use a misspecified version of the regression model to see if we can recover the treatment estimate close to the true value.

```{r}
print(paste("ATE estimated from misspecified regression model:", ATE2_results[[5]]))
print(paste("The standard error is:", sd(store.reg)))
hist(store.reg, main = "Treatment effects using regression")
```

## Discussion 

In our discussion, we explored the causal effect through the lens of the potential outcome framework, emphasizing the crucial assumptions needed for its accurate identification. We particularly focused on the independence assumption and the unconfoundedness assumption, alongside the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) and the overlap assumption. These assumptions play a pivotal role in ensuring valid causal inference, with the conditional independence assumption being highly effective in randomized controlled trials.

However, in observational studies where randomization is not possible, the conditional independence assumption can be quite stringent and challenging to meet as there might be unobserved variables driving the treatment assignment. Consequently, it is essential to leverage alternative methodologies designed for observational settings. Exploring approaches such as propensity score matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity design, and difference-in-differences can help overcome these challenges and improve the robustness of causal effect estimation when randomization is not feasible. By employing these methods, we can better navigate the complexities of observational data and draw more reliable causal inferences.
