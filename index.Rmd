# Work in Progress

This is a work in progress. 

Causal inference, like everything else, is ever-evolving. 
It is a topic that spans across disciplines and has established roots in machine 
learning literature. For the most part, we are trying to figure out whether *X* causes *Y*.
Isn't that essentially what science does -- cause and effect?
