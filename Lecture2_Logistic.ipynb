    "1. College education has a positive effect on health (coefficient = 0.1)\n",

    "reversed for $y_i=0$; higher probabilities will yield higher loss; whereas, lower probabilities \n",
    "will yield lower loss values. So, lower \n",
    "probabilities are 'shunned' for observations with $y_i=1$, and higher probabilities are penalized \n",
    "more for observations with $y=0$. \n",
    "\n",
